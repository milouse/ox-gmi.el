#+title: Gemini Back-End for Org Export Engine

This library implements a Gemini back-end for Org exporter, based on
~markdown~ back-end.  It also heavily depends on the ~ascii~ back-end.

* Install

Obviously, this package depends on /org-mode/, which must be loaded first.

You first need to clone this repository. We recommend you to put it
somewhere under your ~.emacs.d~ folder.

#+begin_src shell
cd ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://git.umaneti.net/ox-gmi.el.git
#+end_src

Then, you may whish to compile it. You can do so with the Emacs command
~M-x byte-compile-file RET \~/.emacs.d/ox-gmi.el/ox-gmi.el~

When it's done, you can add the following line in your GNU Emacs config
file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/ox-gmi.el/ox-gmi.elc")
#+end_src

And everything should be fine.
